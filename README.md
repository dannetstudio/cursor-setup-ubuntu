## üîÑ Differences from cursor-setup-wizard

### No GUM Dependency

Unlike the original `cursor-setup-wizard`, this version does not use **GUM** for user interface prompts. All interactions are handled using standard shell commands (e.g., `read`).

### Support for Nightly/Beta Mode

This script supports both **Stable** and **Nightly** (beta) installations. In **Nightly mode**, it automatically downloads the latest version from the official source.

### Manual Stable Download

Since Cursor AI releases stable versions in stages, the **Stable** download is not automated. You must manually download the Stable AppImage from [Cursor AI's official website](https://www.cursor.com/) and provide the filename when prompted. This ensures that you install the version you want, as the website may sometimes offer an older version than the one already installed.

### Language Support

You can define the language to determine where the script will store and manage files. Set `LANG_SETTING` to `EN` for English or `ES` for Spanish. Depending on the chosen language, download and desktop directories will be assigned accordingly:

- **English (EN):**
  - Downloads folder: `~/Downloads`
  - Desktop folder: `~/Desktop`
- **Spanish (ES):**
  - Downloads folder: `~/Descargas`
  - Desktop folder: `~/Escritorio`

### Run the Script

Before running the script, open `cursor-setup-ubuntu.sh` and verify the `LANG_SETTING="EN"` variable. Set it to either `EN` (English) or `ES` (Spanish) to ensure the correct directory paths are used.

```bash
nano cursor-setup-ubuntu.sh  # Edit this line if needed
```

After verifying the language setting, execute the script:

```bash
./cursor-setup-ubuntu.sh

Once installed for the first time, an alias `cursor-setup-ubuntu` will be created for easy future access. To make it available in your current session, run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash users
source ~/.zshrc   # For Zsh users
```

After this, you can run the script anytime with:

```bash

## üöÄ Usage

### Stable Mode

1. Download the Stable AppImage from [Cursor AI's website](https://www.cursor.com/) (click the "Download" button).
2. When prompted, enter only the filename (e.g., `cursor-0.45.11-x86_64.AppImage`). The file must be located in your `Downloads` folder.
3. The script will install and configure the application accordingly.

### Nightly Mode

1. The script will automatically download the latest Nightly AppImage from [Cursor AI's Nightly builds](https://nightlymagic.cursor.sh/).
2. It will compare the installed version (if any) with the new version.
3. You will be prompted to either update, reinstall, or cancel the operation.

### Simultaneous Installation of Stable and Nightly Versions

- Both **Stable** and **Nightly** versions can be installed and used simultaneously without conflicts.
- The script maintains separate installations:
  - **Stable version:** Launched with `cursor`
  - **Nightly version:** Launched with `cursor-nightly`

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Shortcut & Executable Symlink

- The script creates or updates a desktop shortcut that launches the AppImage with the `--no-sandbox` flag.

- A wrapper script is generated, and a symlink is set up in `/usr/local/bin` so you can launch the AppImage from the terminal:

  - **For Stable:** `cursor`
  - **For Nightly:** `cursor-nightly`

- A single alias (`cursor-setup-ubuntu`) is also created for easy future access to the script.

- The script ensures compatibility with **bashrc** and **zshrc**, so users can execute commands seamlessly from both Bash and Zsh shells.
